and have come further in implementing the functionality we want using HTML, CSS ans JS.

Gaute and Herman collaborated ont the backend tasks, such as learning Spring Boot, user authentication and frontend-backend communication.

2. Frontend
- Completed designs using Figma, made improvements on the design in project.
- Begin implementing frontend functionality using HTML, CSS and JS.
- Introduced JS for dynamic features, such as fetching data from the backend via API endpoints.

3. User authentication

4. Functionality
