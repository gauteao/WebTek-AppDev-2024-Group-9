Sprint report 1, 25-01-2024

Both team members started with looking through the project description and what it is about.
We also started to look into figma as our sketch tool.
We made a group contract.
Started with a basic HTML and CSS code for the skeleton.

For this first sprint both team members have worked close with each other. This is so both of us will be on the same page for the project.
